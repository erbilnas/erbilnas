<h3 align="left">It's-a Me, Erbil!</h3>

I don’t know how to start introducing myself. I can briefly say that I'm an always-learner software engineer who wants to build his future with zeros and ones. I’m 26 years old and I’ve been living in Turkey since I was born, which makes me a Turk naturally. Anyway, let me tell you a little bit of my physical appearance. I’ve got a normal height and slightly weaker weight than usual. Usually, I’m getting around with short hair and a beard. If it’s a sunny day, you’ll see me wearing sunglasses because I’ve got an issue in my eyes. Those damn sun rays, I hate them.

I have loved computer technologies, softwares, and of course, video games since my childhood. Perhaps, this is the biggest reason I chose the profession in software engineering today. (Yeah, definitely it is 🙂) There is no doubt, I’m not an extremely social person because in general I'm not a talkative fellow. But there is an exception. If there are people I love or is something I can talk about, I can be a chatty guy ^_^

Well, what’s happening in my inner world? Let’s take a quick look at what's going on over there. Intelligent, sophisticated, cultured, dignified, gentle, calm, and humble. These are some words that other people say about me. Mostly they’re saying positive based words about me. I think I'm a good fellow 😅. But I don’t care so much about whether I'm good or bad. I’m just trying to do the right thing, not the good one. That’s my lifelong goal and source of my motivation. I tried to introduce myself to you because I wanted that. It’s a little selfish, isn’t it? I hope I succeeded. Take safe care of yourself and have fun. Farewell!
