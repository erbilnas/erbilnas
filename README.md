## 🚀 What I'm Up To

<div align="left">
  
- Currently working on **Trendyol Go by Uber Eats** — building seamless food and grocery delivery experiences for millions of users

- Currently learning **three.js** — exploring the world of 3D graphics and interactive web experiences
- Ask me anything about **frontend engineering** — from Vue & TypeScript to performance optimization and design systems
- Fun fact: **things aren't always #000000 and #FFFFFF** — I believe in the beauty of nuance, both in code and in life

## 💫 The Person Behind the Code

Introducing myself is always a challenge, but here's a brief glimpse into who I am: I'm a software engineer, constantly learning and passionate about building my future with zeros and ones. I'm 28 years old, born and raised in Turkey.

In terms of appearance, I'm of average height and slightly leaner than most. You'll usually find me sporting short hair and a beard, and on sunny days, I'll have sunglasses on due to an eye issue—those sun rays are no friend of mine.

My love for computer technologies, software, and video games dates back to my childhood, which ultimately led me to pursue a career in software engineering. While I may not be the most social person, those close to me know that I can be quite chatty when discussing topics I'm passionate about. ^\_^

As for my inner world, others have described me as intelligent, sophisticated, cultured, dignified, gentle, calm, and humble. While I appreciate these positive qualities, I'm more focused on doing what's right rather than being perceived as good or bad.

I hope this brief introduction gives you a glimpse into who I am. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Take care and stay safe!
